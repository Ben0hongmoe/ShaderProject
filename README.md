# ShaderProject

## Description ##
A container for all sorts of handy shaders in Unity3D.

I created this repository to keep track of all kinds of shader code that I'll be creating while I'm getting back into shader programming and understanding how to use them inside Unity3D. It is my goal of eventually ending up with a rather nice looking database of all sorts of useful shaders that are well commented and understandable for me as well as others who are interested in subject.

### List of Projects in this Repository ###
* Simple Shaders
	* Unlit Coloring
	* Texture mapping
	* Combine two textures
	* Normal maps
	
* Stencil Buffers
	* Portals
	* Mirrors

## Requirements ##
The project must be run on Unity3D version 5 or newer.
